        <p>UPON ENTERING THE TOTALLY NOT HAUTNED FOREST, YOU COME ACROSS A STRANGE CREATURE. IT HAS BIG ALMOST HUMAN LIKE EYES,
            A BIG TOOTHY GRIN, AND WALKS ON TWO LEGS. WHILE TRYING TO QUIETLY MOVE AROUND WITHOUT BEING NOTCED, YOU STEP ON A 
            TWIG ALERTING THEM TO YOUR PRESENCE. THEY TURN TO LOOK AT YOU IN A INSTANT.
