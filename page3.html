        <P>AFTER YOU SAY HELLO, THEY DO NOTHING BUT STARE DEEPLY INTO YOUR EYES. THE STARING MAKES YOU FEEL SUPER AWKWARD, AND 
            YOU REALLY HOPE THEY DO ANYTHING. SO YOU WEAKLY TELL THEM THEY HAVE PRETTY EYES. AFTER THIS COMPLIMENT THEY TELL YOU THAT 
            TO THE LEFT IS TREASURE AND THE RIGHT LEADS TO CERTAIN DEATH.
